# Eigen Algorithm Test

This is a Python implementation of the Eigen Algorithm Test.

## Getting Started

To get started, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies and run the application by following these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download and install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/eigen-algorithm-test.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd eigen-algorithm-test
3. Install the required Python packages (if any). If there's a requirements.txt file, run the following:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Running the Application
To start the application, simply run the index.py file:

    ```bash
    python index.py

This will run the main logic of the Eigen Algorithm Test.
